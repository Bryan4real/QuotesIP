# QuotesIP

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.
This is a simple application that allows you to create a quote and save it, you can also opt to delete a quote you enter and apart from that, the user is able to view already entered quotes and leave a reaction of either upvoting or downvoting.

## Development server

The application employs the use of the node package manager to create an environment required to run it on a local server.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Installation 

After cloning the repository from github. You navigate to the cloned folder through your terminal and install the application using the command `npm i` or (same as) `npm install`
afterwards you have to start the server using the command `ng s` or `ng serve` in order to run it on your browser locally.
